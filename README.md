# TextED ✍️

A simple React application where users can type text and **convert it to Uppercase or Lowercase** with a button click!

It looks like you've listed the features of your app, but there’s a small **repetition** in the text. The **"Convert text to Lowercase"** is mentioned **three times**. Here's a corrected version:

---

## 🛠 Features
- Convert text to **Uppercase**
- Convert text to **Lowercase**
- Capitalise the first letter of each sentence
- Capitalise the first letter after "."
